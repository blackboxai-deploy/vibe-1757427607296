# Live Location Tracking Image Upload - Implementation Progress

## Core Implementation Steps

### 1. Application Structure Setup
- [ ] Create main layout with location permissions handling
- [ ] Create homepage with upload interface and location tracker
- [ ] Create gallery page for uploaded images with location metadata
- [ ] Set up TypeScript interfaces for location and upload data

### 2. Core Components Development
- [ ] Build ImageUploadZone component with drag & drop functionality
- [ ] Build LocationTracker component for real-time GPS capture
- [ ] Build MapDisplay component for location visualization
- [ ] Build ImageGallery component with metadata display
- [ ] Build LocationPermission component for user consent
- [ ] Build UploadProgress component for file upload feedback

### 3. Backend API Development
- [ ] Create image upload API endpoint (/api/upload)
- [ ] Create location processing API endpoint (/api/location)
- [ ] Create image gallery API endpoint (/api/images)
- [ ] Implement file handling and validation utilities

### 4. Utility Functions & Helpers
- [ ] Create location tracking utilities
- [ ] Create file upload and validation utilities
- [ ] Create database/storage utilities
- [ ] Set up TypeScript type definitions

### 5. Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

### 6. Build & Testing
- [ ] Build the application with `pnpm run build --no-lint`
- [ ] Start production server with `pnpm start`
- [ ] Test image upload functionality with curl
- [ ] Test location tracking API endpoints
- [ ] Test user interface and location permissions
- [ ] Validate location data capture and storage
- [ ] Test responsive design across devices

### 7. Final Integration & Preview
- [ ] Verify all features work together seamlessly
- [ ] Test complete workflow: upload → location capture → display
- [ ] Generate preview URL for live demonstration
- [ ] Document API endpoints and usage
